			<h1>Lab 6 - Arrays and Objects</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Getting used to using arrays and writing my own variables into the JS console was a little challenging</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Document.writeIn was a little tough for me as I had absolutely not idea what was happening, but because it was pretty much just linking the console and script output like last lab, I figured it out </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Cool lab, while I do not own the Miata, I said I did because I just wanted to fill the code more and have an actual object that was "myMainRide" instead of a lame bus.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<div id="output"></div>
			</div>
