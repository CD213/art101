					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>I had some difficulty with creating the references, as I tried to do it without help from the guide or my partner, but once I relented and got help it was really easy to understand and put into practice.</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I had a really hard time picking what stupid little photo I would put on my homepage. Also I got a little stuck and confused on which index.html I was editing at some steps.</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This assignment was really fun, as I got to mess with my site more. I feel like I entered it with some lighthearted energy, had a good time working with it and my partner, and overall became more comfy with coding.</p>
